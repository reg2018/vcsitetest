6 characteristics and skills

How will you recognize a good drone pilot in times of Gps navigation, Glonass, anticollision, VPS and several other sensors that have a lot of job off our hands?

I've summarized three crucial daily-life skills that each ambitious and specialist drone pilot needs to master - and three patterns patterns, that show a good pilots knowledge and professionalism in every situation.

Flight without GPS + Glonass
If you want in order to maneuver your drone in an emergency scenario safely, you want to have some understanding of how to utilize the ATTI flight mode.

It simply uses the drones atmosphere pressure sensors, while not holding the position by making use of Gps navigation and Glonass as generally.

That finally signifies that if a wind gust hits the drone, it'll drift with the wind - or in the event that you forget about your remote controller's stay, the drone won't immediately come to rest, but fly on for many meters.

Don't worry, using the ATTI mode is pretty easy - here you find a whole guide and also a video guide of mine.

Manual PoIs
Pilots who can circle objects manually even while always keeping them in the center of the frame, tend to be more experienced.

Most pilots just go ahead and choose DJIs Level of Interest mode to get regular and soft circles done, but with only a lttle bit of practice, that can be done it manually, which is much more precise.

It really is pretty simple: begin flying your drone f.e. to the proper, smoothly, steadily and constantly (usually you employ the proper stick of your distant controller).

Now start rotating the drone slowly round its axis, but the other way round, in this example left.

Once both moves are consistent, your drone will fly an ideal point of interest.

Fly a straight line
Have you ever tried to fly a straight line even while rotating your drone - without needing the

Course Lock mode?

This easy sounding task has put many drone pilots with their limits.

Try to fly at a regular speed and not too slow and begin rotating your drone, while adjusting the drones lessons.

It isn't easy, but after the lump is cracked (while we say found in German "Der Knoten ist geplatzt") your overall flight performance will be far more precise, while you have carved out a genuine sense of controlling your drone.

We have now want to give attention to three features that sometimes indicate a specialist level.

Again, I don't want to check out a made-up situation, but at daily-life behavior just.

Stay calm!
It could sound too simple, but being a self-controlled and calm pilot often avoids crashes from happening and situations from escalating.

Always wonder of the larger picture before you get decisions in complicated situations: are all four propellers even now attached and may be the power level great enough to land found in a safe zone, regardless if it's not the house point - hey, it isn't too that bad in that case. It could be approach worse, and there is normally an excellent potential for saving the bird.

But staying calm will not only connect with in-air situations: is it possible to stay calm and action professionally if someone bothers you when you are flying your drone? Maybe possibly threatens or swears at you? You will be able to de-escalate in the event that you stay calm. Rather than overlook the bigger pictures!

Stay quiet!
Real drone pilots prefer to take pleasure from a safe and nice flight rather than attract attention by any means. The more you give attention to flying the drone rather than yelling around or maybe trying showing the environment that you bought the nicest drone of most times, the fewer concerns you will need to face.

And yes, some pilots love presenting themselves much better than focussing in the actual flight.

It's weird for certain, and no, it generally does not look very professional.

Talking about volumes: perhaps you have taken a look at DJIs low sound propellers already?

Leave the funny sweaters at home!
Should you be joining a drone pilots getting together with or flying with family members only, wearing a sweatshirt that answers some primary questions may be fun. But if you want to be observed as a professional drone pilot, leave the sweater in the home - at least when flying in public areas.

You don't have to talk to spectators on a regular basis, but you can kindly ask them to wait with their problems until you have landed.

Especially nowadays it has become essential that people, the drone pilots community, not merely stand together but talk openly about our hobby/job.

It is crucial that people represent it well, as most of us are pioneers even now and laws are strict plenty of already now.

If you want to acquire DJIs safest drone, you must have a look at this model that may even circle you while autonomously monitoring you without the chance of crashing right into a tree when flying backward.
