#### From Trapped Thai Youth Soccer Team to the Rescue in Extreme Situations


A week after their rescue and hospitalization, members of the Thai youth soccer team "Wild Boar", aged 11 to 16, appeared in a press conference, detailing their 11 days in the flooded cave in Chiang Rai, Thailand.

While the rescue was successful in regard to results, the life of a Thai Navy Seal diver was lost in the process. Rescues, especially in extreme situations, often come with danger to the participants themselves. Just like what Elon Musk, the man behind Tesla and SpaceX did to equip the cave rescuers with an advanced submarine, modern technologies also spare no effort in improving the safety and efficiency in rescuing lives among volcano eruptions, floods, earthquakes and other disasters.

##### Robots in Hazardous Rescues

According to CNN, robots have been applied in rescue operations back in the Hurricane Katrina strike in 2005. They can access places where human-beings would face fatal dangers if entered, like a collapsed building or a flooded lowland. Nowadays robots are easier to control remotely and can replace humans in high-precision rescues.

##### Drones for First Response Search and Rescue

Rescue drones may not be as popular as consumer drones, but they are developed much earlier and applied widely in large area searches. In 2018, a climber was injured and caught up by extreme weather at the Broad Peak around Nanga Parbat, Pakistan at over 8,000 meters above the sea. He was presumed dead until a drone spotted still moving but quite away from the ordinary route. He was rescued thanks to the timely and precise report from the drone pilot. Similar stories can also be found in flood, earthquake and other accident sites where drones can do a better job than people or rovers from above. Drones or UAVs can enter the sites right after the disasters happen, ensuring victims can be detected within the "golden 72 hours". As an outstanding example, the JTT C85 drone can mount different payloads. With an HD camera, it can search a wide area and spot specific human. A gas detector enables it to analyze and warm about hazardous gas in certain areas, helping rescuers learn about site conditions quickly. There is also a 4 in 1 payload that allows for high volume shouting, HD video transmission, and long throw lighting, bringing its capacity to more rescuing scenarios like night vision, maritime rescue and ruins searching. Drones are still evolving every day for better applications.

##### Artificial Intelligence (AI) for the Future

AI has been one of the most heated topics of today's technology world. People have been researching how AI can be applied in future rescues. AI controlled rescue can generate a much faster response to instant issues than human systems can do. Imagine an emergency call center that is entirely run by AI. The call from a victim will generate much more information than it currently does, including precise location, closest rescuers and even images of its surroundings. This will help rescuers locate and rescue the victim much faster.

Technologies are expected to play a more critical role in future rescues, and the development of modern rescuing will not only make rescuing faster, better, but also a lot safer.
