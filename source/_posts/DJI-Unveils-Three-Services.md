As each year, the audience at CES in NEVADA had no reason to be disappointed.

New devices and devices everywhere. Even more, some less useful.

Famous drone manufacturer DJI declared three new products.

Please be aware that DJI has not yet released most of the tech specs of the new products.

DJI Ronin S
When it comes to gimbal stabilizers for ground cameras, every filmmaker recognizes the DJI Ronin series.

The reliable and high-quality stabilizers took part in lots of big film productions already, and even smaller budget filmmakers put it to use frequently.

But still: to most users, the Ronin gimbals were too clunky and for that reason uncomfortable to handle.

DJI now presented the all-latest DJI Ronin S, that was exclusively designed to use smaller sized cameras, like DSLRs or perhaps mirrorless cameras.

Most information have not been published yet, but from insiders we realize that DJI not merely tried to totally change the design, so that it is smaller and convenient to carry, however the fresh DJI Ronin S is supposed to leave the competition behind with various new intelligent consumption features.

An optional external electric motor can also be added, delivering broader compatibility to all or any lens types while boosting precision control.

Innovative Design

All-in-One Control

Portable. Versatile. Ergonomic.
The ergonomic design of the Ronin-S frees undesired shake when shifting from underslung to an upright position in a single smooth take. The detachable design and style offers numerous use scenarios. Mount it to an RC buggy for low-to-the-ground tracking pictures or let it become a stabilized remote head when mounted on a jib. This detachment characteristic also makes it more convenient for easy storage.
