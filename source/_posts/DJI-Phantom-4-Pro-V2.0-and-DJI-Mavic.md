DJI fans were ready long for an revise of the very most famous group of drones, the Phantom series. Now, without fuss and hype, DJI published its brand-new unit: the DJI Phantom 4 Pro V2.0. I briefly summarized what the brand new drone can('t) do.

The expectations were gigantic, just as certain requirements.

Whenever DJI, the worlds major manufacturer of camera drones, announces a fresh model, this means innovations and new exciting technology paired with significant enhancements.

Maybe this is why why the new DJI Phantom 4 Pro V2.0 was published quietly. No live function, not a prominent news release.

 

The brand new DJI Phantom 4 Pro V2.0 can be an update of the so-far innovative model.

Not more, not really less. Whoever expects extra, will be disappointed.

The drone features, like its predecessor, a 1-Inch 4K camera that records (in the best resolution) with up to 60FPS. That's not news.

DJI though installed different ESCs and propellers to make the drone quieter by 4dB, that's approximately 60%.

In times of anxious neighbors, this is pretty relevant for stress and troublefree flights.

Up coming to that, the brand new controller, that may either be used with a smartphone or can be purchased with an incredibly dazzling display (1.000 NITS), now features OcuSync, a fresh transmission system.

The DJI goggles for immersive FPV flights is now able to wirelessly be linked to the DJI Phantom 4 Pro V2.0 (you need to know, that the DJI Mavic Pro can already be used wirelessly with the Goggles since some time).

And that's already it with big media and improvements.

Unfortunately, DJI neither set up a new camera nor does they increase the anti-collision sensors, nor does the battery pack life change.

But we should remember that the DJI Phantom 4 Pro drone is a respected drone with regards to ease of use and camera quality currently now, even though the brand new model's features appear to be quite disappointing.

If you are on the whole enthusiastic about upgrading to the DJI Phantom 4 series or if you wish to buy the most recent drone with an excellent camera aboard, then your new DJI Phantom 4 Pro V2.0 will probably be worth being taken into account.

New DJI Mavic Weather Drone Get Major Improvements

DJI recently announced the DJI Mavic Atmosphere drone. It costs significantly less than 800 USD and has various improvements aboard, that its predecessors could only dream of.

Let's unveil why the Mavic Oxygen is DJIs new client drone flagship.

DIMENSIONS
The new Mavic Air drone may be the smallest 4K Ultra HD drone ever built by manufacturer DJI.

Already that is clearly a significant change!

The drone is way smaller than its predecessors but on the other hand records at the same resolution.

It really is tiny enough to fit into every backpack and may be brought everywhere.

The DJI Mavic Air is the perfect travel companion, and its own size is a milestone in the drone industry.?

 BITRATE
Not only is the size for a 4K drone insane. But the degree of detail the small camera is with the capacity of saving blew me aside when I initial studied the tech specs!
While many opponents and even some much larger DJI drones still record at bitrates between 20 and 60 Mbps, the brand new Mavic Air drone writes its files with 100 Mbps.

That's incredible, all together lot more information will be saved rather than wasted.

This is a noticeable and significant transformation for everyone who aims to create beautiful and cinematic movies.?

INBUILT STORAGE
Another change is the inbuilt storage. Hardly ever includes a DJI drone featured internal memory before. In the event that you ignore your MicroSD card or if it is full after an extended working day of flying and filming, you don't have to worry, as possible record your movies and save your photos to the 8GB of interior storage area. DJI could have added a few extra gigabytes, but we have to remember that the storage area is meant to become a backup!

For day-to-day filming, DJI even so recommends using MicroSD cards.
 
Incidentally: as a result of the high bitrate, you desire a high-speed card.

Find the two best cards the following.?

OBSTACLE AVOIDANCE SYSTEM
Big news, like big news, may be the drones obstacle avoidance system.

Not only may be the drone prepared when appearing in forward flight, but here is the first ever Mavic drone to include a backward facing obstacle avoidance program as well.

The anti-collision cameras will keep your investment safer than previously.

QUICKSHOT MODES
The DJI Mavic Air drone features four Quickshot modes that could already be on the

DJI Spark drone. But DJI added the boomerang method, that looks incredibly cinematic, and the asteroid method, that combines standard filmmaking with photography.?

360 and Tiny World Photos
With the DJI Mavic Air drone, you may take 32MP 360 photos within minutes.

Just one tap in the smartphone permits the mode, and the drone takes a row of pics and automatically stitches them collectively right after.

You can download free RAW photos taken with the DJI Mavic Atmosphere drone right here.

GESTURE CONTROL
Managing the DJI Mavic Weather with gestures is one more significant change.

Ever since the first attempts, DJI worked hard in enhancing the mode.

It was already performing quite nicely on the tiny DJI Spark drone, but with the DJI Mavic Surroundings, they perfected it.

Many new gestures permit the operator to regulate the drone precisely.

It could be flown closer or perhaps farther away from the operator, it really is positioned with a good palm and will take videos or perhaps selfies. Entirely without a remote control controller or smartphone.

PRICING
The pricing is another important change, despite the fact that that sounds a bit weird.

But because DJI saved some cash occasionally, they limited the airline flight range from 7km to approx. 4km and the remote controller does not feature the tiny information screen any more that we were employed to from the predecessor, the DJI Mavic Pro, these were able to sell the

all-brand-new DJI Mavic Air at a good pricing point. It costs less than 800 USD!

You can buy the drone here.?
